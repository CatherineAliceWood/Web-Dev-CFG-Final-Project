I chose to write a prototype Welsh tourism recommendation website. I included some funny little JavaScript prompts just to show what I can do with JS so far.

If I was to develop this site further, I might:
- add more content
- add weather forecast information using JS and an API
- create filter and sort menus
- create links for different areas and the ability to cross-reference between areas and recommendation categories etc.
- add maps
- make the contact us form functioning
